# Steps to get going:
- Fork this repo to your own account using the button at the top.
- Clone the repo to a folder of your choice using the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:ElixirTechCommunity/Pull-N-Merge.git
  ```
- Make a new text file with your name, inside the repo folder. For example: If someone's name is Abc Def, so their file will be named `abc_def.txt`.
- Use this command to tell git that all files need to be committed:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- Then commit the changes using the following command:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: added text file for <your name>" #replace <your name> with your your actual name
  ```
- Push the changes to GitHub by using the command:
  ```bash
  git push
  ```
